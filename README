HDF5 file format for PhaseCapture Camera data developed at the University of Nottingham
This code reads raw captured data, processes and then writes to HDF5 file. 

This code is no use to external users, but may provide examples of methods with HDF5 files. 

Most of the HDF5 code is similar to the HDF5 examples.
